Start
1. Read professors, populate two professor lists (part/full time)
	Professor contains:
		Name
		Number of classes can teach
		Number of students advising (497)
		Times taught evenings last three quarters
		Specialties
		
2. Read classes, populate class lists (core/elective)
	Class contains:
		Name/number
		Time
		Day
		Quarter
		Student limit
		Specialty
		
//Create Schedule
	//Schedule contains:
		//Class and professor links
		//Student count
		
3. Create student list
	Student contains:
		Unique SID
		Classes taken, grades received (or pass/fail)
		Elective credits taken (and passed)
		(Seniority/class)
		
4. Analyze professor and class lists, find occurrences of specialty classes and professors
	//See which specialties are the rarest, so the only Profs that teach X aren't too busy teaching the more general Y
5. For each full-time professor, starting with rarest specialties:
 	If Professor hasn’t taught evenings twice in last three quarters & no professor evening preference:
		Assign professor classes matching specialties (rarest first), evening-weighted.
	Else:
		Assign professor classes matching specialties (rarest first), evening-avoiding.
6. While empty classes remain:
	For each part-time professor, starting with rarest specialties:
		If Part-timers are full:
			Add new professors
 		If Professor hasn’t taught evenings twice in last three quarters & no professor evening preference:
			Assign professor 1 class matching specialties (rarest first), evening-weighted.
		Else:
			Assign professor 1 class matching specialties (rarest first), evening-avoiding.
	
7. For each student (starting with highest seniority):
	If 3 classes they haven’t passed are available:
		Assign 3 classes they haven’t passed.
		UNLESS, they have reached their elective limit.
			Then, assign 3 or fewer core classes.
	Use binomial distribution to determine grades (two sets of input, one for core, one for elective)
	Update grades for student’s next quarter
//Quarter complete
8. If more quarters will be simulated:
	Add new classes
	Add new students
	
9. Analysis 
Return Schedule(s)
